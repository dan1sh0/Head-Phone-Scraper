# Headphone_Price_Scraper 
Welcome to my Headphone Price Scraper! My goal with this project was to find the lowest prices from ebay for the Sony XM4 Headphones. 
To do this, I extracted the prices from multiple pages and put that list into an excel file so I can easily look through myself.
To find the lowest price, I took out the outliers from the biggest prices and used a python library to notify me at a certain time every day.
With these steps, I was able to find the lowest price per day and finally was able to buy myself these headphones at the best price possible!!!!!
